- DB was defined to have "v" number, which especifies the version number
- currently, v3
- later, will compare data from diff versions to make some sense about market (how much price is higher than previous version)

- check craigslist queries

- will deploy using vercel naming, instead of tkwebdev

* to get the system running with vercel: vercel dev
system seems to be fine
connection with DB is okay
query and craigslist data structure is still compatible

need to re-check places (query)
Xand update links - no more tkwebdev but instead vercel naming space
deploy and tests
