#database structure

  insert new items
  update deleted and changed data
Xrun both to check the results
format a mail message to be sent
  1st version is done
  1st version changed and seems to be working, missing more tests

set real craigslist query
set the environment to mail
  on vercel
    pull from github
    set project and variables
    set vercel route
set github action
  .github/workflows
deploy to vercel

convert hour to be at Vancouver time
set send email to Si
still checking github functionallity

algorithm refactored to have an array of queries to make (more than one place) + html msg adjusted + time zone for cron adjusted (7 = 14 & 21 = 4)

fixing cron schedule file (needed to has 2 files because time zone thing)

starting FE (spent much time fixing npm vulnerabilities) + tweakes on cron

set TK's icon and site's info on index.html
set table to show current aptos, with changes (if so), and deleted ones
set about page
set index.js to return and close http connection before sending the mail (it's another process)
fix email table

changed BE so it can handle change on record, price and priceOld
BE procedure to remove record by admin is done, missing more tests and FE
  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ do not forget to change .env file before uploading 
      vercel is done with removePass

FE 1st version is done, 
  Xmissing styling
  Xmessages
  Xaction to removebyowners - add button + confirm + BE + message
  mobile
  Xindex.html - description and icon

  doing mobile, table style is ok but started rethinking the UI structure
  missing modal to:
    show more info, and
    show option to remove by Admin

    need to rethink the UI table structure
    AptosList has <table> <thead> (mobile or web) <tbody> (mobile or web)
    4 diff components: TheadMobile, TheadWeb, TbodyMobile and TbodyWeb
    modal for removeByAdmin and for TbdodyMobile
    modal is working for availables, missing style and copy for the other types (rbo and rba)
      implement slowly collapse for rbo and rba
  axios functions refactored plus tried modal for everything, but, turns out, it is gonna be only for mobile. It is working but missing style.
  basic css for modal and going to deploy first full version - BE + FE + mobile and web

compare algorithm small fix plus table tweeks
send message fixed, + db inconsistency + added lastUpdate field to BE and Modal, missing to update screen and large screen
UI improvements + expand/collapse for tables rmo and rba

XmarginBottom for table rba with 3rem paddingBottom
Xnot send email to Si
Xtable order by lastupdate
  seems to be working fine
Xstarting about page
starting about page + tweaks on table and main page + BE sorting items
update rba table  after removing from available
web modal has to have less width to large screens, currenty too large
